# DoorDarshan

DoorDarshan is an access control system that allows members of the RoboTech Club at NISER to remotely lock and unlock the door to the club's lab using Discord chat commands. It uses a Raspberry Pi computer interfaced with an electronic door lock and custom Discord bot software to provide secure keyless entry. Authorized club members who have access to the DoorDarshan Discord channel can issue simple textual commands to toggle the state of the lock without needing physical keys. Additionally, a display screen positioned outside the lab door connects to the Raspberry Pi to showcase important club announcements, including upcoming events, authorized lab access lists, weather and time information. This project was conceived to enhance security and convenience of lab access. It also served as a hands-on IoT and robotics learning experience involving hardware integration, embedded programming, and software development. Overall, DoorDarshan demonstrates an automation solution for secure remote access control and management.

## Objectives

- **Develop an Integrated Access Control and Information System:** Design and implement a system using a Raspberry Pi and electronic solenoid lock, enabling door control via Discord commands and displaying information on an external screen.
- **Facilitate Monitoring and Transparency:** Utilize Discord commands for door access to log entry and exit, allowing clear monitoring of who accesses the club room and when.
- **Explore and Document Key Technical Concepts:** Design, learn and record important aspects of Raspberry Pi programming, electronic lock integration, Discord API usage, and real-time data display.
- **Educate and Engage Club Members:** This project also helps in learning and understanding how to make Discord bots using python.
